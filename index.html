  <p> At the begining of the symester the software engineering class was given a task to complete a  1000 points html and css crsah course in a month, so i decided to make time every evening to do that <br> For about a week was given the task to host my own website and share the link with my course mates using the free code camp projects we were given and after finally completeing the 1000 points on the free code camp site i use some artificial inteligence to find out some tips and tricks about hosting websites and as the old saying goes"every thing is on youtube"</p>
  <h2>THE WEB HOSTING</h2>

  <p> After watching alot of  youtube videos and looking for hosting platforms that i could host a website for free i finally remembered that i couldhost my website from my github repository for free so then I went on github and tired to host my wbsite and  after several failed personal tries my roomate assisted me in finally deploying my website onto github after i submitted the link to our web programming group but , i was the second person to submit my website link in the software engineering class</p>
  <P>You can Visit my<a href="https://bigg30.github.io/index/"> website</a></P><br>

    <h2>MY EXPECTATIONS</h2>
    <p>  Seeing my website finally live on GitHub Pages was an incredibly rewarding moment. It not only validated the countless hours I had invested in learning web development but also boosted my confidence in overcoming technical challenges. Collaborating with my roommate taught me the value of teamwork and the importance of seeking assistance when needed. <br>
        Sharing my project with the web programming group and receiving constructive feedback from my peers further enhanced my understanding and highlighted areas for improvement.<br>
         Being the second to submit my website in the software engineering class also gave me a sense of accomplishment and motivated me to continue refining my skills. <br>
         Moving forward, I am excited to implement new features, optimize the user experience, and explore more advanced hosting options to better showcase my work and contribute effectively to future projects.
